-- vLLM PR cycle time breakdown
-- Computes P50 and P90 (hours) for:
-- 1) Time to first (human) review: PR ready -> first human review
-- 2) Time to approval: first human review -> first approval
-- 3) Time in merge queue: first approval -> merge time
-- Notes:
-- - "Ready" is derived from the first time the 'ready' label was applied.
-- - Reviews excluded if state = 'DISMISSED' and if reviewer looks like a bot.
-- - Human review is approximated via author_association in an allowed set and reviewer != PR author.
-- - Metrics only consider merged PRs within the window [startTime, stopTime).
