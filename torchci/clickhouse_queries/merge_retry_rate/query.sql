-- Query to calculate average merge retry rate for recent period
-- Merge retry rate = average number of merge attempts before first successful merge
-- Only counts attempts up to when the PR was closed/merged (proxy for dev friction)
-- Filters by PR creation date
-- Excludes pytorchupdatebot PRs to avoid skewing metrics with stuck bot updates
