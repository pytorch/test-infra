// Guidelines for writing rules:
// - Start with ^ if you can, it makes filtering out non-matching lines faster.
// - Try to make sure the produced "captures" field is useful:
//   - It should have enough information to identify the failure.
//   - It should be groupable; e.g. there should be no random noise in the capture group.
// - If no capture groups are specified, the "captures" field is the whole match.
//
// - Try to match against as much information as possible, so that captures are interesting.
//     For example, instead of 'error: ', do 'error: .*'
// - You can use capture groups to filter out line noise, so that we can aggregate on captures.
//     For example, for the failure 'FAIL [10.2s]: test_foo', 'test_foo' is a
//     good capture group, as it filters out test timings which might be
//     variable.
