# Rules for matching logs against.
# The rules are ordered by priority, first rule being the highest priority.

# Guidelines for writing rules:
# - Use a raw string literal ('single-quote') to avoid having to escape
#   characters, or a multi-line string literal ('''triple-quote''') if your
#   string has a single-quote character inside it.
# - Start with ^ if you can, it makes filtering out non-matching lines faster.
# - Try to make sure the produced "captures" field is useful:
#   - It should have enough information to identify the failure.
#   - It should be groupable; e.g. there should be no random noise in the capture group.
# - If no capture groups are specified, the "captures" field is the whole match.
# - Try to match against as much information as possible, so that captures are interesting.
#     For example, instead of 'error: ', do 'error: .*'
# - You can use capture groups to filter out line noise, so that we can aggregate on captures.
#     For example, for the failure 'FAIL [10.2s]: test_foo', 'test_foo' is a
#     good capture group, as it filters out test timings which might be
#     variable.
